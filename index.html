    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Kamesh, a passionate Cybersecurity Enthusiast, Developer, and CTF Player with strong skills in programming, penetration testing, and bug bounty hunting. I enjoy exploring security vulnerabilities, building tools, and solving complex challenges through hands-on experience.

My technical expertise covers C, C++, Python, Bash, Swift, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with deep knowledge of cybersecurity methodologies. I actively work with tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, Hydra, Wireshark, Dirsearch, and Hashcat for security testing and research.

I regularly participate in CTF competitions, specializing in web exploitation, steganography, cryptography, and reverse engineering. My long-term goal is to grow as a security professional, contribute to building safer digital systems, and stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.</p>
